= MongoDB Service Broker for Pivotal Cloud Foundry 
Tested with MongoDB 2.6, and PCF 1.6.9+

== Getting Started

. Install and run MongoDB somewhere accessable by Cloud Foundry
* If necessary, create a new authorized admin user for pcf to provision with
+
----
$ mongo --host yourhost admin -u username -p password
> use admin
> db.createUser({
	user: "pcfadmin",
	pwd: "changeme",
	roles: [ "root", "userAdminAnyDatabase" ]
})
----

. Checkout the MongoDB service broker (this repo) from github
* *Option 1 (recommended):* 
+
Use Ops Manager to import this repo's included *.pivotal* artifact: 
+
----
mongodb-broker/tile/product/mongo-db-for-pcf-0.1.8.pivotal
----

* *Option 2 (advanced):* 
+
Build yourself: requires link:http://cf-platform-eng.github.io/isv-portal/tile-generator/[Tile Generator] installed
+
----
$ cd mongodb-broker/service-broker
$ mvn clean
$ mvn package
$ cd ../tile
$ tile build
----
+
Use Ops Manager to import the newly created *.pivotal* artifact
+
----
mongodb-broker/tile/product/mongo-db-for-pcf-0.X.X.pivotal
----

. Create security group needed by the tile config (you can override this if you wish by flipping the flag in tile.yml)
+
----
$ cf create-security-group all_open tile/release/src/templates/all_open.json
----

. Use OpsManager to configure and deploy the tile
